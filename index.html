                    <h4>Modern JavaScript | Food Truck</h4>
                    <p>For this project, I worked with a partner to develop a website for an imaginary food truck. This website would use JavaScript to dynamically load menu items and events. Each page would follow a consistent design, including an admin page that allows for adding, editing, or deleting menu items and events. I improved my JavaScript skills, and gained collaborative experience by using version control and dividing responsibilities with my partner.</p>

                    <h4>C# Intermediate | Banking</h4>
                    <p>For this project, I built a banking application in C# that managed customer data, deposits, and withdrawals. The first version of the project uses flat file interaction for data persistence, and the second version utilizes a database. I learned about N-Tier Architecture, and how applications are divided into logical layers. I also got to practice File I/O and database integration in a real-world application.</p>

                    <h4>Data Admin Techniques | Final Project</h4>
                    <p>For this project, I implemented a relational database using MSSQL. In this database, I set up logins, users, and roles to manage permissions. I also developed migration scripts, and performed data reporting through Excel and PowerBI. Lastly, I made use of SQL functions, stored procedures, cursors, and triggers. I gained experience in database design, security, and data visualization.</p>

                    <h4>Database Engineer</h4>
                    <p>These projects highlight my experience in database design, security, and automation. They also demonstrate my ability to integrate databases with applications and data reporting tools. The Banking App in specific, reinforced my understanding of N-Tier Architecture, where I implemented a solution with proper logical layers. The Food Truck project helped me further understand full-stack interaction.</p>
